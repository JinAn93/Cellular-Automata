Duke CompSci 308 Cell Society Project

#### Name: 

Joseph Lilien (jrl48), Jin An (sa190), Huijia Yu (hy91) 

#### Date started:

2/1

#### Date finished:

 2/13

#### Hours worked: 

29

#### Resources used: 

Java FX documentation, Cellular Automata (from The Nature of Code, Daniel Shiffman), XML- managing data Exchange

#### Main class file:

 Main.java

#### Data (non Java) files needed:

 All files are provided in repository.  Non-java files include the XML configuration files, ButtonLabels.properties, XMLTags.properties, Interface.properties, Sliders.properties, States.properties, and custom.css

#### Contributions:

* Joe: Design and implementation of SimulationRules super class and  SimulationRules subclasses, abstraction of CellManager class and Display class

* Jin: Implementation of XML manager class and the CellManager class.  Also designed formate for XML config files and handled most XML challenges, exceptions etc

* Huijia: Design and implementation of Display, UserInterface, and Time classes, including additional shapes, graph, and interactions

Although the contributions described above represent those areas of the project we were each in charge of, we came up with the overall design together as a group and spent a lot of time working together, often doing partner coding, to solve some of the difficult design challenges and make the program's classes function together properly.  We also helped each other out with the more difficult aspects of each task.

#### How to run the Simulation:

Click the 'Load File' Button, choose the initial configuration file for the simulation of choice, click 'Start' button.  The running simulation can be paused, restarted, sped up or slowed down, stepped through, and stopped mid way to run a new simulation by loading new XML configuration file.  Sliders control simulation parameters as indicated and any configuration can be saved to an XML file by hitting the save button.

#### Known bugs: 

After hitting the load file button, the file must be loaded immediately (user cannot hit cancel button)

#### Extra features: 

None

#### Impressions/Suggestions: 

This project definitely included some challenging design obstacles to get over and included a new dynamic of coding as part of a team.  However, we planned our design well and worked very efficiently both individually and as a team to complete this project effectively and successfully.  Our code was flexible for the most part and required no drastic changes for these new implementation challenges
